In order for sengrid to work, I had to run the install Certificates command for Python. This is part of Python, so I assumed it didn't count as an additional required package, but I wanted to make a not of it in case SendGrid was not properly sending emails (which it was for me, once the command was run). I've included screenshots of where I found the Install Certificates command, and what it looked like in terminal once it was run.
